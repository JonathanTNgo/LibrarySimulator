# LibrarySimulator

Library Simulator is a fully Java application meant to establish OOP princples.

This console application was created by https://github.com/JonathanTNgo

Purpose: Simulate a small-scale library system with customer-interaction.

Functionality: 
    - Add/Delete/View Library objects
	
    - Add/Delete/View Customers (loanees)
	
    - Add/Delete/View Loans (IE. Customers checking out library objects)

Additional Infomation:
    - You can extend off of LibraryObject, but you will have to add a add(BLANK) function to LibrarySystem.java

Optional Improvements:
    - Factory interface to handle the creation of new LibraryObjects, to help scale application
	
    - Better distinction of SOUT between librarySim and LibrarySystem (Some functions will print, others will return ActionStatus enum instead)


Thank you!
